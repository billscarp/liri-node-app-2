What happened to her plan?
Only been with one man
When she turned twenty four
Her dreams went out the door
Husbands a CPA
One Prozac a day
She never had it all
Debbie just hit the wall
Is she there, or is she trying to give me the slip?
Did your mom get back from her business trip?
We can hang around by the pool
Stacy, can I come over after school?
The ninety nine red balloons go by
And focusing it on the sky
Opens up one eager eye
The war machine springs to life
There's something here from somewhere else
Panic bells, its red alert
Floating in the summer sky
Ninety nine red balloons
